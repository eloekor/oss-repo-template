It is important to choose a license because it allows you to establish clear and definied boundaries
with what you may or may not want other people doing with your code/project. This is a core basis for open source projects as you are explicitly giving people permission to work with your property.

# 4
It is important to not work on a project without a license because in that scenario you do not have permission to do the work that you are doing. This leaves you open to possible lawsuits or other recourse as you are working with intellectual property that you otherwise do not have explicit access to.

I agree with the claim established within the article that an aspect of Gopher's downfall was unwillingness to follow the open systems model. As brillient as their workers may have been, ultimately it is the market that decides the value of and evaluates a product. By forsaking the possibility of letting other developers contribute and express their opinions on Gopher's technology, Gopher doomed themselves to fall short to the people who welcomed community collaboration.

A core aspect of Android is allowing users the freedom to achieve a true custom experience with their devices. For this purpose an Apache license 2.0 makes sense for them as they actively encourage their users to provide meaningful contributions and customize software to their tastes.
