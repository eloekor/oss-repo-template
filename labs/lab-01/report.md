## Part 2_3. Break down steps even when you believe the knowledge to be trivial. Be respectful and give proper attention to the askee. 

## Part 2_4. Upon reading chapter three of Free Culture, I grew very sympathetic to the injustice Jesse had to deal with. It exposed the very slippery slope that exists in regards to working with public technology and copyright laws. Growing up you always hear about not pirating movies or games or shows, but very infrequently are you educated on the true nature and reach of copyright laws. It was shocking to witness how drastically ones life could be affected by a combination of ignorance and misinformation. As this story of Jesse originates from 2002, I am now curious as to whether laws have been reformed in some way to offer more protection as open source has exploaded in popularity throughout the years. This piece defintely gives me the motivation and drive to learn more about the law in regards to working on open source projects and having a more fundamental understanding of what I can or can not do.
